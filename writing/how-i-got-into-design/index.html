      <h2 id="how-i-got-into-design">How I got into design</h2><p>I always enjoy reading others stories about their path into design. What made them want to go down the path of becoming a designer generally resonates with some younger version of myself. I have to think back to</p><p>My path into design isnâ€™t a predictable one. I stumbled here and there and found a landing spot in design. In high school I was extremely excited to be involved. My main passion was found in the theatre. I loved being able to walk up on stage and pretend to be something that I wasnâ€™t, and in particular I loved improv and comedy. Singing, not so much. So when I didnâ€™t get offered a position in the musical. From that point I found the world of technical theatre.</p><p>All throughout the rest of high school I opted for building sets, hanging and programming lights, and stage managing. Pretty soon it seemed like the next course of action would be to just go off and keep doing this because itâ€™s what I enjoyed. I got accepted at a college in Oklahoma for a degree in Lighting Design and joined. While in college I struggled to keep up with the day to day tasks as well as the work in the shop, and I even joined a fraternity. Overall you could say that I spread myself a little thin.</p><p>I donâ€™t like talking about myself, this is all very uncomfortable for me, but probably good.</p><p>I also got my first time serious girlfriend. And we hit it off pretty well. She joined me over the summer in Wichita Kansas while I worked as a carpenter for a musical theatre company. And later in our Junior year we learned that we were going to have a child together. Now, this is where I had to figure out something to do pretty quickly.</p><p>Thatâ€™s how it felt at least. I did not want to be the guy that went off to college, life ahead of him, and ended up going into a career that he didnâ€™t like because he got someone he was with pregnant. That was not the life that I was planning to have for myself. So I talked to my friend and roommate who was working at a small tech agency doing some light photoshop work to see if they would let me intern for free. Just so that I could learn stuff like photoshop and what an app is.</p><p>This is where I entered tech. A scared college kid just looking for a way out. I knew that theatre design would be a rewarding, but ultimately punishing and slow moving career. And it wasnâ€™t the theatre that I really liked about it, really what appealed to me was designing something. The art of <strong>storytelling</strong> and how I could add or take away from that with the timing of a dramatic light cue or the color of backlight as it filled a scene just perfectly. I also loved being able to collaborate and work with people.</p><p>So I began as a unpaid intern, working my way into web design. The start of my career wasnâ€™t anything special. I cut my teeth exporting assets in photoshop. I was also finishing out college in a design degree, but a different design than I planned to move forward with. I was also learning to be a parent at 21. If youâ€™re becoming a parent for the first time, donâ€™t do it while doing all of the stuff that i was. believe me.</p><p>From there I have worked at 5 different companies, Iâ€™ve married the girl of my dreams, Iâ€™ve purchased a home in Oklahoma City, and Iâ€™ve continued to raise my kiddo who will be 8 by the time that this is published.</p><p>Hopefully that story can help someone, Iâ€™m still growing, Iâ€™m still getting my feet under me, but Iâ€™m grateful for the journey that led me here and Iâ€™m happy to share it. ðŸ––</p>
